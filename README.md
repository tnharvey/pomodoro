Pomodoro Timer created by (Erick J)[https://github.com/ey-Jay] and (Neal H)[https://github.com/tnharvey] for The Odin Project (TOP) pair programming project.

Pomodoro timer is a productivity tool that, once started, cycles through a work period (session) and a break period (break). After four consecutive
sessions, the fourth break is then a long break for recovery. We strove for simplicity in design, eliminating unnecessary buttons or displays. The layout
is also responsive, and should perform well across platforms as well.

Future Features:
- Impliment as Google Chrome Extension
