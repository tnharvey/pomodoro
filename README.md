This project was created for [The Odin Project (TOP) pair programming project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project).

A [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a productivity tool that, once started, cycles through a work period (session) and a break period (break). After four consecutive
sessions, the fourth break is then a long break for recovery. We strove for simplicity in design, eliminating unnecessary buttons or displays. The layout
is also responsive, and should perform well across platforms as well.

Future Features:
- Impliment as Google Chrome Extension
